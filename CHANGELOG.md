# Changelog

All notable changes to MurmurLRS are documented here.

## Unreleased

- Distinguish authentication rejects from extra packets ignored after a time slot already has valid data in optional receiver diagnostics.

## v0.9.0 (2026-10-02)

- Derive the master key from the complete binding phrase, independently of the public ELRS UID. Require a nonempty phrase and keep generated secrets out of compiler flags and build logs.
- Establish authenticated HMAC-SHA-256/HKDF sessions with fresh directional traffic keys. Hold application traffic until confirmation, preserve replay history across connection/rate changes, and stop traffic before counter exhaustion.
- Limit encrypted packet verification to two decryptions per call and retain recovery-search progress across disconnects. Revisit missed counter epochs after timing corrections.
- Fix secure 2.4 GHz hopping between SX128x receivers and LR1121/LR2021 transmitters by assigning domain IDs by RF band.
- Protect Wi-Fi maintenance with an independent management credential. Block firmware export and unauthenticated TCP/MSP/UDP services in encrypted builds; preserve the stock configuration path.
- Quiesce ESP8285 receiver radio/timer callbacks before entering its UART bootloader. Package compressed receiver images for wired and Wi-Fi updates.
- Add optional receiver authentication, timing and rejected-packet diagnostics without exporting keys or channel payloads.
- Add private paired firmware builds with explicit hardware profiles and revision/checksum manifests, plus CI-gated source releases.
- Restore encrypted compilation, ESP8285 TX EEPROM initialization and classic ESP32 UART separation after upstream integration. Add LilyGO T3-S3 LR1121 targets and encrypted firmware coverage across seven configurations.

### Compatibility and verification

Rebuild both endpoints from this release with the same high-entropy binding phrase and use its Lua script. Earlier encrypted firmware is incompatible. Wi-Fi management requires a separate `MURMUR_WIFI_PASSWORD`; wired flashing remains available.

Regression coverage includes 62 crypto/acquisition tests, 147 stock native tests, 57 encrypted integration tests (58 with diagnostics), provisioning/packaging checks and session-parser sanitizers. Disarmed hardware checks demonstrated restart and repeated 250/500 Hz recovery. Further hardware qualification is tracked in #22; the short tags, cleartext SYNC and lack of forward secrecy remain protocol limitations.

## v0.8 (2026-05-17)

### Fix: link dies after 5 minutes at 500Hz

Bug reported by community tester: LQ drops to 0-2 after ~131 seconds at 500Hz. Root cause: 8-bit epoch masking in acquisition mode. After 65536 packets (131s at 500Hz), `murmur_nonce_epoch` exceeds 255. Acquisition searched `epoch & 0xFF`, so it could never find the correct counter.

- **32-bit epoch acquisition**: Removed `& 0xFF` mask. Acquisition state (`acquire_epoch`, `acquire_scan_pos`) widened to `uint32_t`.
- **Outward-spiral locked search**: Replaced linear ±256 search with outward spiral (±1, ±2, ... ±4 epochs). Eliminates MAC false-positive ordering issues.
- **Nonce-1 epoch boundary fix**: When `nonce=0`, `nonce-1=255` correctly uses the previous epoch for decryption.
- **Acquisition threshold gate**: Acquisition no longer returns `true` on single MAC hits. Requires 3 consecutive same-epoch matches before passing packets upward.
- **MurmurTrackNonce**: ISR hook on OtaNonce++ keeps RX epoch synchronized during RF dropout, preventing multi-epoch drift on signal recovery.
- **TX reboot recovery (scan wrap)**: If acquisition scans 256 epochs forward without locking, wraps scan position to 0. Handles TX reboot while RX was at high epoch.
- **MurmurResetCounter resets epoch to 0**: Handles TX reboot on full disconnect path.
- 50 total tests (32 crypto + 10 acquisition + 8 epoch overflow regression)

## v0.7 (2026-05-10)

### Epoch acquisition state machine

Fixes the "timing" bug where TX and RX only connect if powered on within ~1 second of each other. Previously, if TX had been running longer than RX, the RX could never find the correct encryption epoch.

- **Sliding window epoch search**: RX scans 16 epochs per received packet, sliding forward on each miss. Finds any epoch within 16 packets worst-case (~32ms at 500Hz).
- **Nonce-1 tolerance**: Acquisition accepts nonce or nonce-1 to handle ±1 drift during PFD phase-lock convergence.
- **Consecutive-hit requirement**: 3 consecutive matches at the same epoch required to lock. Misses reset the count (prevents non-consecutive false hits from accumulating).
- **Lock fallback**: If locked RX gets 16 consecutive decryption failures (TX rebooted at different epoch), drops back to acquisition instead of staying permanently stuck.
- **MurmurSyncNonce**: SYNC packets in tentative state re-sync the nonce without resetting acquisition progress. Only a full disconnect triggers MurmurResetCounter.
- ISR-safe: bounded to 32 decrypt attempts per packet (~0.7ms worst case at 500Hz)
- 9 new acquisition mode tests (41/41 total)

## v0.6 (2026-05-01)

### Encryption fixes

- Fix OTA4 authentication failure: header byte contamination from crcHigh bits caused every OTA4 packet MAC to fail. OTA4 now uses only packet type bits (2-bit) as AEAD associated data. OTA8 continues to authenticate the full header byte.
- Fix epoch desync: TX and RX could permanently lose sync if TX had been running longer than RX (epoch drift). TX nonce space is now monotonic (never resets epoch). RX enters acquisition mode after SYNC — searches epoch 0-255 with 3-packet confirmation before locking in. No weakening of authentication.
- 3 new OTA header-as-AD tests (32/32 total)
